# How to make a cup of coffee using an Aeropress

## Use Case: 
< As a coffee drinker, I want to make a cup of coffee.
------------------------------------------------
### Initial Draft:
I *get* the aeropress(plunger, brew chamber, and filter cap), one aeropress filter, one coffee cup, one liquid measureing cup (one cup *minimum*), electric kettle with temperature control, kitchen scale, coffee (16 grams ground), and two cups of water (*minimum* for kettle), and one teaspoon, one timer.

Put the aeropress filter in the filter cap and screw it clockwise on the brew chamber.

Pour *at least* two cups of water in the water pitcher but *no more* than 8 cups.  Press power *button* followed by temperature control *increment* button until the screen read 175 degrees *if* it reads higher then *decrement* down to 175 degrees.

Place the aeropress on the scale, zero the scale, and weigh out 16 grams of coffee beans directly into the brew chamber, *if* I weigh too much, I put them back in the bag of coffee *else if* I weigh too little, I add more coffee to the scale, *else* I proceed to the next step.

Add water and *stop* if water exceeds top of brew chamber.  Place plunger inside of brew chamber and Set timer to two minutes





START:
IF coffee >= 16 grams AND water >= XX
